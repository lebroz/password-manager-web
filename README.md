# Requirements

This project uses [this module](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-google-vault/tree/master/examples/vault-cluster-private-with-public-lb) to setup the infrastructure on Google Cloud Platform.

You will need to create google images with [this module](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-google-vault/tree/master/examples/vault-consul-image) using [Packer](https://www.packer.io/) from Hashicorp.

Once the infrastructure is setup you can use the website.
